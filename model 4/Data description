This model works on data where videos have strictly code genrated black background color.
We did this because the previous three models had been given data that already had videos with black background while being shot.
But this may not always happen. 
So model 4 and model 5 are gonna look at videos that are going to have code generated black background.
Also in this model the resolution of the images is (80*80*3).

In this model we make use of transfer learning.
Our model contains one input layer that expects an input of (batchSize,17,224,224,3).
Then we take an Inception model and pass the 17 frames through 17 parallel pipelines each pipeline being the following:
  A lambda layer that divides the entire input by 225 and then passes the result to the Inception model.
Then we take all these 17 outputs and concatenate them.
Finally this output is given to a LSTM.
